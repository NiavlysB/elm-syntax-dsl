module Elm.Comments exposing (Comment(..), CommentPart(..), DocComment, FileComment)

{-| A component DSL that helps with building comments.

It is useful to have this in a structured way, so that it can be re-flowed by
the pretty printer, and so that an understanding of the layout of the doc tags
can be extracted to order the exposing clause by.
